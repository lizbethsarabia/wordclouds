# wordclouds
---
1. For my wordcloud searches I have decided to use Seattle as my primary point of research. For wordcloud-1 I used the parameters "seattle", "emerald city", and "seattle, wa" for my seach. For worldcloud-2 I used the locations "Seattle", "tacoma", and "olympia" as my location parameters.
2. I wanted to make this comparision to see what different vibes and topics the search would have on Seattle vs other major cities in Washington state. I also wanted to see what the difference would be in search results vs videos uploaded from locations.
3. Between the two worldclouds I didn't see many simularities apart from a few broad themes like music and outdoor lifestyle. The differences were mainly that the first worldcloud obviously focused on only Seattle. The words had to do with themes like famous spots and scenery. On the other hand, the second worldcloud mainly had words related to olympia and working out.
4. These differences are probably because the first world cloud focused on Seattle and the search results I got from those related parameters. Therefore, the results focused on content ABOUT Seattle, which is why it has more words related to lifestyle and scenery.

   The second worldcloud was made of results of videos that were posted from those key parameters, therefore thats why we had more unrelated hits like bodybuilding and working out.
